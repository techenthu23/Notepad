DevOps team lead who's facing issues with the Product Engineering teams. The main problem seems to be that the DevOps team is being sidelined because Product Engineering is handling DevOps tasks themselves, but they don't want to support or maintain what they build. The DevOps team wants to work on automation and manage the tools, but there's no clear division of responsibilities. Morale is low, and there's talk of dissolving the DevOps team if things don't change.

First, I should break down the key issues here. The user mentioned that Product Engineering teams are doing DevOps tasks like automation but not maintaining them. The DevOps team's approach is that if they build it, they support it, but they're being bypassed. Also, the user points out that PoCs and PoVs are focusing on automation instead of their intended goals like feasibility analysis, ROI, etc. This leads to automation being treated as an implementation detail rather than part of the core objectives.

The DevOps team lead wants to communicate these concerns to other team leads. They need points to present their case effectively. Let me think about what points would address the problem.

1. **Clarify Roles and Responsibilities**: There's a lack of segregation of duties. Everyone is doing everything, leading to overlap and confusion. The DevOps team should have a defined role, especially in maintaining and enhancing automation, while Product Engineering focuses on their core tasks.

2. **Sustainability and Ownership**: If Product Engineering builds automation but doesn't maintain it, that creates technical debt. The DevOps team could take ownership of maintenance, ensuring long-term sustainability.

3. **Focus on Core Objectives**: PoCs/PoVs should focus on assessing feasibility, ROI, etc., not just automation. Automating during PoC might lead to rushed solutions not meant for production.

4. **Collaboration Over Silos**: Instead of dissolving the team, establish collaboration frameworks. Maybe DevOps can consult on best practices while Product Engineering handles implementation with guidance.

5. **Skill Utilization**: The DevOps team has expertise in tools and automation that isn't being used. Their skills could be leveraged better if roles are clear.

6. **Risk of Redundancy**: If DevOps is dissolved, there might be inconsistent practices, leading to inefficiencies. Centralized DevOps can ensure standards and reduce duplication.

7. **Proposed Structure**: Suggest a model where DevOps handles tooling, CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, while Product Engineering integrates these into their workflows with DevOps support.

8. **Governance Model**: Implement a governance framework to define who does what, with input from all teams to get buy-in.

9. **Metrics and Accountability**: Define metrics for successful automation, like reduced deployment times, fewer incidents, etc., to show the value of proper role segregation.

10. **Long-term Strategy**: Align DevOps with organizational goals, showing how a dedicated team contributes to scalability and innovation.

I need to make sure these points address the concerns about being sidelined, lack of role clarity, and the potential dissolution of the team. Also, emphasizing collaboration and the value of a dedicated DevOps team in maintaining standards and sustainability is key. The user wants to pass on these concerns, so the points should be structured logically, perhaps starting with the problem, then the impact, and then proposed solutions. Maybe also address the issue of PoCs/PoVs not focusing on their main goals, leading to subpar automation that isn't maintained. Highlighting the importance of separating initial feasibility analysis from implementation details would be important here.

Another angle is the business impact: if automation isn't properly maintained, it could lead to higher costs down the line, which affects ROI. The DevOps team's role in ensuring that automation is sustainable and well-maintained could be a strong point. Also, the morale issue needs to be addressed because if the team isn't engaged, productivity and quality might drop.

Possible counterarguments from Product Engineering might be that they want autonomy or faster iterations. So the DevOps team lead needs to position DevOps as enablers rather than gatekeepers. Maybe propose a collaborative approach where DevOps provides tools and frameworks that Product Engineering can use, thereby maintaining standards without slowing them down.

Including examples or analogies might help, like how in software development, frontend and backend teams have overlapping areas but clear responsibilities. Similarly, DevOps and Product Engineering can have defined boundaries.

Also, the user mentioned that dissolving the team is being considered. To counter this, the points should show the risks of not having a centralized DevOps function, such as inconsistent practices, security vulnerabilities, and lack of expertise in maintaining complex systems.

Finally, the conclusion should be a call to action for collaboration, role clarity, and governance to ensure both teams work effectively without stepping on each other's toes. The goal is to present solutions that benefit the whole organization, not just the DevOps team.


To address the challenges faced by your DevOps team and communicate concerns effectively to other leads, here are structured points to present:

### **1. Clarify Roles & Responsibilities**
- **Problem**: Overlapping duties lead to confusion and inefficiency. DevOps is sidelined despite their expertise in sustainable automation.
- **Impact**: Lack of ownership causes technical debt when Product Engineering builds but doesn’t maintain automation.
- **Proposal**: 
  - Define clear boundaries: Product Engineering focuses on product development; DevOps owns automation lifecycle (design, implementation, maintenance).
  - Formalize handoffs for automation post-PoC/PoV to ensure DevOps manages enhancements and support.

### **2. Align PoCs/PoVs with Core Objectives**
- **Problem**: PoCs/PoVs prioritize automation over validating feasibility, ROI, and technical limitations.
- **Impact**: Rushed automation becomes unsustainable, creating maintenance gaps.
- **Proposal**: 
  - Restrict PoCs/PoVs to analysis (e.g., ROI, integration compatibility). 
  - Involve DevOps early to advise on automation design for long-term viability.

### **3. Ensure Sustainability & Ownership**
- **Problem**: Ad-hoc automation by Product Engineering lacks accountability for maintenance.
- **Impact**: Unsupported tools increase operational risk and costs.
- **Proposal**: 
  - DevOps takes ownership of automation post-implementation to ensure scalability and updates.
  - Establish SLAs for collaboration (e.g., DevOps reviews automation before production).

### **4. Leverage DevOps Expertise**
- **Problem**: DevOps skills in tooling and infrastructure are underutilized.
- **Impact**: Low morale and wasted resources.
- **Proposal**: 
  - Centralize DevOps as the authority for tooling standards (CI/CD, IaC, monitoring).
  - Product Engineering adopts DevOps-provided frameworks for consistency.

### **5. Mitigate Risks of Dissolving DevOps**
- **Problem**: Redundancy and inefficiency if DevOps dissolves.
- **Impact**: Inconsistent practices, security gaps, and duplicated efforts.
- **Proposal**: 
  - Retain DevOps as a center of excellence for governance and best practices.
  - Highlight risks: Fragmented toolchains, lack of cross-team knowledge sharing.

### **6. Collaborative Governance Model**
- **Proposal**:
  - Create a cross-functional governance board to define responsibilities and escalation paths.
  - Jointly agree on metrics (e.g., deployment frequency, incident recovery time) to measure success.

### **7. Long-Term Strategic Value**
- **Proposal**:
  - Position DevOps as enablers of scalability and innovation, not gatekeepers.
  - Align DevOps goals with organizational priorities (e.g., reducing time-to-market, cost optimization).

### **8. Call to Action**
- **Immediate Steps**:
  - Workshop to redefine roles and handoff processes.
  - Pilot a governance framework for 1–2 projects.
  - Regular retrospectives to refine collaboration.

### **Key Messages to Convey**
- “Our goal is to empower Product Engineering, not block them. Clear roles free both teams to focus on their strengths.”
- “Unmaintained automation risks business continuity. Let’s partner to build solutions that last.”
- “Dissolving DevOps risks fragmenting expertise. Let’s instead structure collaboration to amplify impact.”

By framing these points around shared goals (e.g., efficiency, innovation, risk reduction), you’ll foster buy-in while addressing team concerns.



Okay, the user is a DevOps team lead facing challenges where other teams are handling DevOps tasks, leading to role confusion and lack of ownership. The DevOps team is being sidelined, and there's talk of dissolving the team because "everyone does everything." The user wants to address this and understand if dissolving the team is the right move, especially since other teams (like L3 Engineering) lack automation skills but still consume the tools. They also want to know how other organizations handle this.

First, I need to validate whether dissolving the DevOps team is a good idea. In many cases, DevOps is a culture, not just a team, but having a dedicated team can help maintain standards and best practices. If you dissolve the team without proper structure, you risk inconsistency and technical debt. So, the answer should caution against dissolution unless there's a strong alternative in place.

Next, the issue of L3 teams not having the skills to manage automation but consuming it. This creates a dependency without responsibility. The response should suggest upskilling, clear ownership, and maybe a Center of Excellence model where the DevOps team provides frameworks and support.

Looking at how other orgs handle this: Some have embedded DevOps engineers in product teams, others use a hybrid model with a central team for governance. Highlighting these examples can help the user propose alternatives.

The user might also be concerned about team morale and the long-term viability of their role. Addressing the importance of clear roles and the risks of not having a DevOps team is key. Also, emphasizing collaboration over dissolution, perhaps through a governance model or shared responsibilities with training.

Need to make sure the points are practical, actionable, and backed by examples from other organizations. Also, reassure the user that dissolving the team isn't the only option and provide steps to improve the current situation.

Here’s a structured breakdown of your concerns, along with industry perspectives and actionable recommendations to address the situation:

---

### **1. Should DevOps Teams Dissolve If "Everyone Does Everything"?**
**Short Answer**: No. Dissolving the DevOps team in a "do-everything" culture often leads to **fragmented ownership**, inconsistent practices, and long-term operational risks.  
**Why It’s a Mistake**:  
- **Skill Gaps**: While teams may attempt automation, they often lack expertise in DevOps principles (e.g., scalability, observability, IaC standards), leading to brittle solutions.  
- **No Accountability**: Without a dedicated team, maintenance and improvements fall through the cracks (e.g., L3 Engineering lacks skills but still consumes automation).  
- **Tool Sprawl**: Teams adopt disjointed tools without governance, increasing technical debt.  

**How Other Orgs Handle This**:  
- **Hybrid Models**:  
  - **Embedded DevOps**: DevOps engineers are embedded in product teams but report to a central DevOps leader for governance.  
  - **Center of Excellence (CoE)**: DevOps acts as a CoE, owning toolchains, standards, and mentoring product teams (e.g., Microsoft, Netflix).  
- **Shared Responsibility**: Product teams build features; DevOps owns pipelines, infra, and compliance (e.g., AWS’s "You Build It, You Run It" *with guardrails*).  

**Key Argument**:  
- "Everyone doing everything" often means **no one is accountable**. DevOps teams exist to **scale excellence**, not gatekeep. Dissolving them risks chaos unless replaced with a CoE or governance framework.

---

### **2. Addressing L3 Engineering Skill Gaps**  
**Problem**: L3 teams consume automation but lack skills to maintain it.  
**Consequence**: DevOps becomes a "cleanup crew" for poorly built automation, hurting morale.  

**Solutions**:  
- **Shift-Left Training**:  
  - DevOps provides training/workshops to L3 teams on automation frameworks (e.g., Terraform, CI/CD best practices).  
  - Co-develop automation scripts with L3 during PoCs to ensure maintainability.  
- **Automation as Code (GitOps)**:  
  - Store automation in version-controlled repos. DevOps reviews PRs to enforce standards.  
- **SLA-Based Support**:  
  - Define tiers of support (e.g., L3 handles basic troubleshooting; DevOps handles infra-level fixes).  

**Industry Example**:  
  - **Spotify**: Squads (product teams) own their code, but a central infrastructure team maintains platform reliability and provides self-service tools.  

---

### **3. Why "Everyone Does Everything" Fails Without Structure**  
- **Reality Check**: Most orgs that dissolve DevOps teams **regret it** unless:  
  - Product teams are already highly skilled in DevOps practices (rare).  
  - A mature platform engineering team exists to provide self-service tools (e.g., Uber’s internal developer platform).  
- **Common Outcomes**:  
  - Teams reinvent the wheel (e.g., 5 different CI/CD pipelines).  
  - Security/compliance gaps emerge (e.g., no centralized monitoring).  
  - Burnout increases as L3 teams juggle coding + ops without expertise.  

**Data Point**:  
  - 2023 Puppet State of DevOps Report: Teams with dedicated DevOps CoEs see **60% faster deployments** and **50% lower failure rates**.

---

### **4. How to Advocate for the DevOps Team**  
**Talking Points for Other Leads**:  
1. **Risk Mitigation**:  
   - *"If everyone builds automation but nobody maintains it, we risk outages, security breaches, and wasted engineering hours. Let’s assign clear ownership."*  
2. **Business Alignment**:  
   - *"Our goal isn’t to gatekeep but to ensure automation is scalable and compliant. DevOps can focus on enabling L3 teams with frameworks, freeing them to focus on product features."*  
3. **Cost of Dissolving**:  
   - *"Without DevOps, we’ll duplicate efforts (e.g., 3 teams building the same Terraform script) and lose institutional knowledge. Let’s optimize collaboration instead."*  

**Propose Alternatives to Dissolving**:  
- **Option 1**: DevOps becomes a **Platform Engineering team**, providing self-service tools (e.g., internal CI/CD templates, IaC modules).  
- **Option 2**: DevOps **co-owns automation** with product teams via:  
  - Mandatory peer reviews for critical scripts.  
  - Quarterly maintenance rotations (L3 and DevOps share upkeep).  

---

### **5. Final Recommendations**  
1. **Define Guardrails, Not Gatekeeping**:  
   - Publish lightweight DevOps standards (e.g., "All Terraform must use these modules").  
   - Use automation governance tools (e.g., Open Policy Agent, Atlantis).  
2. **Adopt a Product Mindset**:  
   - Treat DevOps as an internal service provider. Survey L3 teams to build tools they *actually need*.  
3. **Measure Impact**:  
   - Track metrics like "Time to Remediate Automation Failures" to prove DevOps value.  
4. **Escalate Strategically**:  
   - If leadership pushes dissolution, propose a 3-month experiment:  
     - *"Let’s trial a ‘no DevOps’ model but track incidents, costs, and deployment frequency. If metrics degrade, we revert."*  

---

### **Key Takeaway**  
Dissolving DevOps without a mature alternative (e.g., platform engineering) will likely harm productivity and morale. Instead, reposition the team as **enablers** who:  
- Reduce cognitive load for L3 teams.  
- Ensure automation is secure, scalable, and reusable.  
- Focus on strategic work (e.g., optimizing cloud costs, improving observability).  

By framing DevOps as a **force multiplier** (not a bottleneck), you’ll align with leadership goals while protecting your team’s value.


Okay, so the user is considering renaming their DevOps team to a Platform Engineering team. They want to know if this is meaningful and how to justify it. Let me start by recalling the previous conversation. The user is a DevOps team lead facing issues where other teams, especially Product Engineering, are handling DevOps tasks without proper handover or maintenance. The DevOps team is being sidelined, leading to low morale. The user mentioned possibly dissolving the team if things don't change.

In the last response, I suggested that dissolving the DevOps team isn't the answer and proposed alternatives like becoming a Platform Engineering team. Now, the user wants to know if renaming would be meaningful and how to justify it.

First, I need to explain the difference between DevOps and Platform Engineering. DevOps is more about culture and practices, while Platform Engineering focuses on building internal tools and platforms. Renaming could help clarify the team's role, especially if their current role is misunderstood or if they're being bypassed.

But I need to justify why the rename makes sense. Maybe the current name "DevOps" is causing confusion because other teams think DevOps is just about automation, not about building sustainable platforms. Platform Engineering might better convey the creation of self-service tools and standardized workflows.

Also, the user mentioned that L3 teams lack skills to manage automation. Platform Engineering could provide these teams with ready-to-use tools, reducing their burden. This aligns with industry trends where companies like Spotify and Airbnb have Platform Engineering teams to enable product teams.

I should highlight the benefits: clearer responsibilities, reduced duplication, better governance. Also, mention that renaming isn't just a label change but a strategic shift towards enabling other teams through internal platforms.

Need to address potential concerns. For example, stakeholders might think it's just a name change without substance. So, the justification must include structural changes like defining the team's new scope, creating self-service tools, and establishing governance.

Also, provide examples from other organizations where renaming to Platform Engineering improved collaboration and efficiency. Mention reports or studies, like the Puppet State of DevOps Report, to add credibility.

Finally, outline steps to transition, such as redefining the mission, communicating the change, developing key platforms, and measuring success. This makes the justification actionable and shows it's a well-thought-out plan, not just a superficial change.


Renaming your DevOps team to a **Platform Engineering team** can be meaningful and strategically impactful **if** the new name aligns with a redefined mission, scope, and value proposition. Below is a structured justification for this change, along with industry context and actionable steps to ensure success:

---

### **1. Why Rename DevOps to Platform Engineering?**
**Core Issue**: The term "DevOps" is often misunderstood as a role (e.g., "tools team") rather than a cultural practice. This leads to ambiguity in responsibilities and misalignment with organizational goals.  
**Platform Engineering**, by contrast, is explicitly outcome-driven: it focuses on **building and maintaining internal platforms** that abstract complexity for product teams, enabling them to self-serve while ensuring standardization and governance.

#### **Key Justifications**:
- **Clarity of Purpose**:  
  - **DevOps Team (Current Perception)**: Seen as a "catch-all" for automation, leading to role overlap and confusion.  
  - **Platform Engineering Team (Future State)**: Explicitly owns the **internal developer platform (IDP)**—tools, pipelines, and infrastructure that product teams consume.  
  - Example: Spotify’s "Backstage" or Airbnb’s "Binary Authorization" are IDPs built by platform teams.  

- **Alignment with Industry Trends**:  
  - Gartner predicts that **80% of large enterprises will adopt platform engineering by 2026** to streamline DevOps workflows.  
  - Companies like Netflix, Uber, and Shopify use platform teams to reduce cognitive load on developers and enforce best practices.  

- **Mitigates Current Challenges**:  
  - **Problem**: Product teams build ad-hoc automation without accountability for maintenance.  
  - **Solution**: Platform Engineering provides standardized, reusable tools (e.g., CI/CD templates, IaC modules) that product teams *consume* but don’t *own*.  
  - **Problem**: L3 teams lack automation skills.  
  - **Solution**: Platform Engineering abstracts complexity (e.g., self-service dashboards for provisioning) so L3 teams focus on their core work.  

---

### **2. How Platform Engineering Differs from DevOps**
| **Aspect**               | **DevOps Team**                          | **Platform Engineering Team**          |  
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|  
| **Primary Focus**          | Cultural adoption, CI/CD pipelines, collaboration. | Building and maintaining internal platforms/tools. |  
| **Ownership**              | Shared responsibility (often ambiguous). | Explicit ownership of the IDP and governance. |  
| **User Interaction**       | Embedded collaboration with teams.       | Provides self-service tools for teams to consume. |  
| **Outcome**                | Faster deployments, better collaboration. | Reduced cognitive load, standardized workflows. |  

---

### **3. Strategic Benefits of the Renaming**
#### **For the Organization**:
- **Reduces Duplication**:  
  Product teams no longer waste time reinventing Terraform/Ansible scripts; they use pre-approved modules from the platform.  
- **Improves Governance**:  
  Centralized ownership of tools (e.g., SIEM integration, DLP policies) ensures compliance and security.  
- **Accelerates Development**:  
  Developers self-serve via internal platforms (e.g., one-click staging environments) instead of waiting for DevOps.  

#### **For Your Team**:
- **Regains Relevance**:  
  Shifts from being "bypassed" to becoming **enablers** of product teams.  
- **Focus on High-Impact Work**:  
  Instead of firefighting ad-hoc automation, the team builds scalable platforms (e.g., Kubernetes orchestration, observability pipelines).  
- **Career Growth**:  
  Platform Engineering is a **top-demand skill** (e.g., CNCF projects, cloud-native tooling) and aligns with industry trends.  

#### **For Product/L3 Teams**:
- **Simplifies Workflows**:  
  L3 teams consume pre-approved tools instead of struggling with automation they can’t maintain.  
- **Reduces Risk**:  
  Guardrails (e.g., policy-as-code, pre-vetted IaC) prevent misconfigurations in critical areas (Network, DLP).  

---

### **4. How Other Organizations Use Platform Engineering**
- **Shopify**: Platform team built "Spin" (internal PaaS) to abstract infrastructure, letting developers focus on features.  
- **LinkedIn**: "Developer Productivity" team provides self-service tools for CI/CD and monitoring.  
- **Goldman Sachs**: Platform Engineering owns the "Developer Nexus" for standardized cloud workflows.  

**Data Point**:  
  - 2023 State of Platform Engineering Report: 68% of organizations with platform teams saw **faster onboarding** for new developers, and 54% reported **reduced operational overhead**.

---

### **5. How to Structure the Platform Engineering Team**
#### **Scope of Work**:
1. **Internal Developer Platform (IDP)**:  
   - Self-service portals for provisioning resources (e.g., AWS accounts, Kubernetes clusters).  
   - Pre-approved CI/CD templates (e.g., GitHub Actions workflows, ArgoCD configurations).  
2. **Standardization & Governance**:  
   - Policy-as-code (e.g., Open Policy Agent) for network/DLP compliance.  
   - Centralized logging/metrics (SIEM integration).  
3. **Toolchain Ownership**:  
   - Own and maintain tools like Terraform, Vault, Prometheus, and Backstage.  
4. **Enablement**:  
   - Training, documentation, and sandbox environments for L3 teams.  

#### **Team Structure**:
- **Embedded Liaisons**: Platform engineers assigned to partner with Product Engineering/Network teams.  
- **SRE Sub-Team**: Focus on reliability of the platform (e.g., SLIs/SLOs for internal tools).  

---

### **6. Addressing Concerns and Gaining Buy-In**
#### **Anticipated Pushbacks**:
1. **"This is just a rename!"**  
   - Response:  
     - "This is a strategic shift from ‘doing DevOps’ to ‘providing a platform.’ We’ll deliver measurable outcomes: X% faster deployments, Y% fewer security incidents."  
2. **"Product teams want autonomy."**  
   - Response:  
     - "Platform Engineering enables autonomy *with guardrails*. Teams can self-serve without worrying about compliance or reinventing wheels."  

#### **Metrics to Prove Value**:
- Reduction in time-to-provision environments.  
- Fewer critical incidents caused by ad-hoc automation.  
- Increased adoption of self-service tools (e.g., 80% of teams using platform CI/CD templates).  

---

### **7. Steps to Transition**
1. **Redefine the Mission**:  
   - Publish a charter: *"We build and maintain secure, scalable platforms to accelerate product teams."*  
2. **Communicate the Change**:  
   - Host a workshop with stakeholders to explain the "why" and "how."  
3. **Build Quick Wins**:  
   - Launch a self-service Kubernetes namespace provisioning tool.  
   - Share pre-built Terraform modules for AWS/GCP.  
4. **Phase Out Legacy Processes**:  
   - Deprecate ad-hoc automation in favor of platform tools.  

---

### **Conclusion**
Renaming your DevOps team to **Platform Engineering** is not just a rebrand—it’s a strategic repositioning to address systemic issues like fragmented ownership, skill gaps, and unsustainable automation. By focusing on **platform-as-a-product**, your team will:  
- Provide tangible value to L3 and product teams.  
- Regain control over governance and scalability.  
- Align with industry best practices (and hiring trends).  

**Final Recommendation**: Proceed with the rename, but pair it with a **clear roadmap** (e.g., 3-month platform deliverables) to demonstrate its impact. Use terms like "Internal Developer Platform" and "self-service" to resonate with leadership and product teams.
